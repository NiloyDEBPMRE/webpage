<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px">The active fow optimization and the entropy generation of a spinning porous cylinder on laminar mixed convective fow in 
a lid-driven diferentially heated square chamber have been explored numerically in this study. The cold top surface of the chamber is sliding in the right direction at a fxed velocity, while the cylinder is rotating at a fxed angular velocity, either assisting or opposing the main fow. Navier–Stokes and thermal energy equations defne the transport phenomena, while an averaging approach via the Darcy–Brinkman–Forchheimer model is implemented for the porous medium. Three diferent mixed convection cases based on Reynolds number (31.62≤Re≤316.23), Grashof number (103≤Gr≤ 105
), and Richardson number (0.1≤Ri≤10) are considered in the fow optimization along with the alteration of rotational Reynolds number (Rec=10, 0, −10), size (λ=0.3, 04, 0.5), and position (1–5) of the cylinder. Quantitative evaluations of thermal performance are done in terms of mean Nusselt number, Bejan number, performance evaluation criterion, and thermal performance criterion. The optimization study primarily supports clockwise rotation at the central position of the porous cylinder with specifc sizes (diameters) based on the ranges of governing parameters in each simulation case. It is found that the porous cylinder’s rotation primarily determines fuid fow across the porous area.</p>
