<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px">A thorough investigation of free convection and entropy generation occurring inside a differentially heated square chamber that is filled with water and divided by a water-saturated, corrugated porous partition is performed in this numerical study. The governing mathematical equations, that describe the flow and heat transfer phenomena for fluid and porous domains, are the Navier-Stokes (modified for the porous domain using the Darcy-Brinkman-Forchheimer model) and thermal energy equations. Those systems of equations are solved using the Galerkin finite element analysis. Parametric changes are carried out for different positions, thicknesses, amplitudes, and frequencies of corrugation of the porous partition, and the corresponding results are quantitatively presented in terms of average Nusselt number along the heated wall and total entropy generation of the entire chamber with increasing Rayleigh number (103 ≤ Ra ≤ 107). Corresponding variations are qualitatively visualized in terms of streamlines and isotherms for comparing the related parametric changes. Furthermore, a comparative analysis is included between the use of porous and solid partitions along with a chamber without any partition. Conclusive results show that using a porous rather than a solid partition can increase the average Nusselt number by 26.28% at Ra = 105 up to a maximum of 565% at Ra = 107. Similarly, lower thickness, higher frequency, and higher amplitude can increase the average Nusselt number by around 37.5%, 2.89%, and 1.17%, respectively.</p>
