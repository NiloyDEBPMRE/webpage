<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px">The comment below addresses an inaccurate formulation in the calculation of the Nusselt number for linear heating as presented in the paper titled “Steady natural convection flows in a square cavity with linearly heated side wall(s)” by M. Sathiyamoorthy, T. Basak, S. Roy, and I. Pop, Int. J. Heat Mass Transfer 50 (2007) 766–775. Consequently, this analysis provides a mathematical reformulation for the local and mean Nusselt numbers of a linearly heated side wall. It regenerates a few quantitative results for a specific case solely intended for comparative purposes.</p>
